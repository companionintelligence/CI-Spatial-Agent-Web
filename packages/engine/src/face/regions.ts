 * regions.ts — the canonical facial vocabulary, partitioned by anatomy.

 * (GLB morph targets, Oculus `viseme_*`, VRM expressions) is reached through an
 * adapter that translates down from it, so producers never branch on rig type and
 * a mapping lives in exactly one place.
 *
 * Keys are grouped into REGIONS because that is the unit of contention. Two
 * producers wanting `jawOpen` is not the interesting case; a speech engine and an
 * emotion engine both wanting "the mouth" is. Ownership is resolved per region
 * (see FaceCompositor), which is what stops a smile from flattening a viseme.
