/**
 * FaceCompositor — the single owner of every facial weight the avatar shows.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Before this, the render loop ran two lip-sync engines and an emote service that
 * each wrote `morphTargetInfluences` / `expressionManager.setValue` directly, in
 * sequence, every frame. Whoever ran last won, so a smile could flatten a viseme,
 * an FFT path with no audio could pin the mouth shut, and a dirty-cache in one
 * writer was silently invalidated by the other — leaving VRM mouths stuck closed.
 *
 * The fix is not "order the writers more carefully"; it is to remove the ability
 * to write at all. Producers submit weighted contributions to a named layer, the
 * compositor arbitrates once per frame, and exactly one write reaches the rig.
 *
 * ARBITRATION
 * -----------
 * 1. Contributions to a region a layer does not own are dropped.
 * 2. A layer may CLAIM a region for the frame. The highest-priority claimant
 *    suppresses every lower-priority layer in that region — including keys the
 *    claimant did not write, which fall to rest. This is what "speech owns the
 *    mouth while speaking" means, and it is the whole reason emotion can no
 *    longer smear a viseme.
 * 3. Surviving contributions combine by blend mode, ascending by priority.
 *
 * RELEASE
 * -------
 * A key written last frame but not this frame decays toward rest rather than
 * being abandoned at its last value. Stuck morphs — a frozen expression after a
 * barge-in, a mouth held open after the audio stopped — are all this bug, and
 * the compositor is the only place it can be fixed once.
